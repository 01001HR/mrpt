List of pending stuff to be integrated into MRPT someday:


 PRIORITY LIST
==================

- Multimetric map: add support for new weighted point map.
- Fix WifiMaps... (WTF was this??)


  WISHLIST FOR THE THREE WISE MEN
=====================================

- Optimize loading of textures in mrpt::opengl::*
- Make sparse Kalman implementation, if would improve anything.
- Colour point clouds store colors as u8 insteaf of float.
- Point cloud maps: replace virtual methods by CRTP
- 3D rendering windows & glCanvas should have functors for the user to call custom gl primitives.
- icp-graph-slam
- Add \ingroup Doxygen tags to document mrpt-* libs
- CColouredPointsMap no longer has a the "m_min_dist" field: Create a new class?
- ANN lib: replace by custom implementation, smaller with only KD-trees + SSE optimizations
   + avoid duplication of point buffers + make unit tests.
- KLT tracking: make custom implementation: with explicit pyramids, subpixel, ...
