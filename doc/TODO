List of pending stuff to be integrated into MRPT someday:


 PRIORITY LIST
==================

- Fix WifiMaps... (WTF was this??)
- doc: Finish list of dependencies
- icp-graph-slam
- Integration of PCL via a new pointcloud class??


  WISHLIST FOR THE THREE WISE MEN
=====================================

- Make sparse Kalman implementation, if would improve anything.
- Colour point clouds store colors as u8 insteaf of float.
- CColouredPointsMap no longer has a the "m_min_dist" field: Create a new class?
- KLT tracking: make custom implementation: with explicit pyramids, subpixel, ...
