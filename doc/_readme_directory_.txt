The "docs" directory contains the documentation generated by doxygen. 

See the directory "scripts" for instruction on rebuilding the MRPT documentation.

The directory "images" is for temporary stored images. Add new images to "design_of_images"
or "screenshots" if they are referenced in the doxygen documentation.

The final ".chm" file is copied to the root directory.
