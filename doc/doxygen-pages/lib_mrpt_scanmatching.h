<h2>Library <code>mrpt-scanmatching</code></h2>
<hr>

Under this name we find functions in charge of solving the optimization problem of aligning a set of correspondences, both in 2D and in 3D. 
Note that this does not includes the iterative ICP algorithm (see mrpt::slam::CICP), included in another library (mrpt-slam). 

See mrpt::scanmatching
