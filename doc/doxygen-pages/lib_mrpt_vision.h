This library includes some extensions to OpenCV functionality, plus some 
original classes:

- mrpt::vision::CFeature: A generic representation of a visual feature, with or without
patch, with or without a set of descriptors.

- mrpt::vision::CFeatureExtraction: A hub for a number of detection algorithms and 
 different descriptors.

- mrpt::vision::CVideoFileWriter: A class to write video files.

- This library defines a new type of observation (mrpt::slam::CObservationVisualLandmarks)
  and a new type of map (mrpt::slam::CLandmarksMap).
