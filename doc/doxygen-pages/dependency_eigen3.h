<h2>Dependency: <code>eigen3</code></h2>
<hr>

MRPT crucially relies on Eigen3, so this dependency is mandatory. Still, for convenience of users, if Eigen3 is not present 
in the system MRPT's CMake build system will automatically switch to an embedded version of this library. 

Read more about the integration of MRPT and Eigen3 in http://www.mrpt.org/Matrices_vectors_arrays_and_Linear_Algebra_MRPT_and_Eigen_classes
