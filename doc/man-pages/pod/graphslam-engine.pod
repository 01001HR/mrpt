=head1 DESCRIPTION

Aim of the app is to B<perform 2D graph-slam>: Robot B<localizes> itself
in the environment while, at the same time B<builds a map> of that environment.
App currently executes SLAM using MRPT rawlog files (both MRPT rawlog formats are
supported) as input which should contain (some of) the following observation types:

=over 4

=item * B<CObservationOdometry>

=item * B<CObservation2DRangeScan>

=item * B<CObservation3DRangeScan>

Working with 3DRangeScan is currently in an experimental phase.

=back

The majority of the graphslam-engine parameters in each case should be specified in
an external .ini file which is to be given as a command-line argument. The
following parameters can also be specified as command-line arguments:

=over 4

=item * B<.ini-file> [REQUIRED]

Specify the .ini configuration file using the -i, --ini-file flags.
Configuration file parameters are read by the main CGraphSlamEngine class as well
as the node/edge registration schemes, and the optimization scheme.

=item * B<rawlog-file> [REQUIRED]

Specify the rawlog dataset file using the -r, --rawlog flags.

=item * B<ground-truth>

Specify a ground truth file with -g, --ground-truth flags. Ground truth has to
be specified if user has set I<visualize_slam_metric> or
I<visualize_ground_truth> to true in the .ini file, otherwise an exception is
raised.

=item * B<Node/Edge registration decider classes to be used.>

Specify the node registration or/and edge registration decider classes to be
used using -n, --node-reg, -e --edge-reg flags.

If not specified the default CFixedIntervalsNRD, CICPCriteriaERD are used
as node and edge registration decider schemes respectively.

=item * B<Optimizer class to be used>

Specify the class to be used for the optimization of the pose-graph using the
-o --optimizer flags. Currently the only supported optimization scheme is
Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear graph optimization defined in optimize_graph_spa_levmarq
(http://reference.mrpt.org/devel/group__mrpt__graphslam__grp.html#ga022f4a70be5ec7c432f46374e4bb9d66)

If not specified, the default CLevMarqGSO is used.

=head1 PROGRAM INPUT/OUTPUT

By default graphslam-engine execution generates an output directory by the name
"graphslam-results" within the current working directory. The output directory
contains the following files:

=over 4

=item * CGraphSlamEngine.log

Logfile containing the activity of the CGraphSlamEngine class instance.
Activity involves I<output logger messages>, I<time statistics> for critical
parts of the application, and summary statistics about the constructed graph
(e.g. number of registered nodes, edges).

=item * node_registrar.log, edge_registrar.log, optimizer.log

Logfiles containing the activities of the corresponding class instances. File
contents depend on the implementation of the corresponding classes but in most
cases they contain I<output logger messages>, I<time statistics> for critical
parts of the class execution.

=item * output_graph.graph

File contains the constructed graph in the VERTEX/EDGE format. The latter can
be visualized using the MRPT graph-slam application for verification reasons.

For more information on this, see: http://www.mrpt.org/Graph-SLAM_maps
http://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/application-graph-slam/

=item * output_scene.3DScene

File contains the 3DScene that was generated in the end of the
graphslam-engine execution. The latter can be visualized using the
MRPT SceneViewer3D tool.

For more information on this, see
http://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/application-sceneviewer3d/

I<Note:> File is generated only when the visualization of the graph construction
is enabled in the .ini configuration file. See .ini parameters as well as the
--disable flag for more on this.

=item * SLAM_evaluation_metric.log

File contains the differences between the estimated trajectory increments and
the corresponding ground-truth increments and can be used to verify and
evaluate the performance of the SLAM algorithm. For more information on the
metric, see "A Comparison of SLAM Algorithms Based on a Graph of Relations -
Burgard, Wolfram et al."

I<Note:> File is generated only when the ground-truth of the corresponding dataset
is given.

=back

I<Note:> In case a directory named graphslam-results, generated during a previous
execution, exists it is, by default, overwritten. If this is not the desired
behavior, user can set the I<user_decides_about_output_dir> .ini parameter to
true so that they are asked about this naming conflict during program execution.

=head1 APPLICATION DESIGN

In this section insight into the graphslam-engine application - and
corresponding library - is provided.

// TODO - Add here

=head2 REGISTRATION DECIDERS

The registration decider classes are divided into node and edge registration
deciders. The former are responsible of adding new nodes in the graph while the
latter add additional edges between I<already added> graph nodes.

=head3 NODE REGISTRATION DECIDERS

Node registration decider schemes add nodes to the graph according to a
specific criterion. Node deciders should implement the methods defined in the
CNodeRegistrationDecider abstract class.  CNodeRegistrationDecider provides the
basic methods that have to exist in every node registration decider class. For
an example of inherenting from this class see CFixedIntervalsNRD.

As a naming convention, all the implemented node registration deciders are
suffixed with the NRD acronym.

// TODO - check if link works
For more information on this see http://reference.mrpt.org/devel/classmrpt_1_1graphslam_1_1deciders_1_1_c_node_registration_decider.html

=head3 EDGE REGISTRATION DECIDERS

Edge registration decider schemes add edges between already added nodes in the
graph according to a specific criterion. Edge deciders should implement the
methods defined in CEdgeRegistrationDecider abstract class.
CEdgeRegistrationDecider provides the basic methods that have to exist in
every edge registration decider class. For an example of inherenting from
this class see CICPCriteriaERD.

As a naming convention, all the implemented edge registration deciders are
suffixed with the ERD acronym.

// TODO - check if link works
For more information on this see http://reference.mrpt.org/devel/classmrpt_1_1graphslam_1_1deciders_1_1_c_edge_registration_decider.html

=head2 OPTIMIZERS

Optimizer schemes optimize an already constructed graph so that the registered
edges maximally agree with each other. Optimizer schemes should implement the
methods defined in CGraphSlamOptimizer abstract class. For an example of
inherenting from this class see CLevMarqGSO.

As a naming convention, all the implemented graphslam optimizer classes
are suffixed with the GSO acronym.

For more information on this see http://reference.mrpt.org/devel/classmrpt_1_1graphslam_1_1optimizers_1_1_c_graph_slam_optimizer.html
