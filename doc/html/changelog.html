<h2>Version 0.9.1: (In developement)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Most important changes:</b><ul>
<li>CRITICAL REGRESION FIXED: The program rbpf-slam did always crash at start-up in MRPT 0.9.0.</li>
<li>Many new stuff and improvements in mrpt-vision, e.g. mrpt::vision::CGenericFeatureTracker, mrpt::vision::CFeatureList, etc.</li>
<li>New command-line dataset manipulation tool: rawlog-edit.</li>
<li>New library: mrpt-detectors</li>
<li>(TODO) Fixed support for pkg-config with a new set of libmrpt-*.pc files (see new example MRPT/doc/mrpt_example1-with-Makefile).</li>
<li>Support for Videre Stereo cameras (By Cyril Gerber, thanks!)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Detailed list of changes:</b><ul>
<li>Changes in applications:<ul>
<li>camera-calib can now open SwissRangers 3D cameras as well for real-time calibration.</li>
<li>rawlog-grabber: New config file optional argument: "rawlog_GZ_compress_level" to settle the desired GZ-compression level of rawlogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes in classes:<ul>
<li>mrpt::utils::CImage:<ul>
<li>It now has a new method (setFromImageReadOnly) and a new constructor as UNINITIALIZED_IMAGE.</li>
<li>New alternative checkerboard detector algorithm (by Scaramuzza et al.). See mrpt::utils::CImage::findChessboardCorners for references and more details.</li>
<li>findChessboardCorners() is no longer a method of CImage, but a function in mrpt::vision (see mrpt::vision::findChessboardCorners).</li>
<li>New method to compute KLT response at any given position: mrpt::utils::CImage::KLT_response</li>
<li>New efficient constructor to build a grayscale version of another image, or a fast "link" if it was already grayscale. See CImage::CImage( img, FAST_REF_OR_CONVERT_TO_GRAY )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many classes: UNINITIALIZED_* which were defines have been transformed into enums to keep all that stuff into MRPT namespaces.</li>
<li>mrpt::vision::CFeatureExtraction has a new option FASTOptions.use_KLT_response.</li>
<li>mrpt::slam::CObservation now has virtual load() and unload() method to manually invoke delayed-load (actually only needed by 3D camera observations).</li>
<li>stlplus::smart_ptr templates now have an extra template argument "COUNTER" which defaults to an thread-safe atomic counter but can be set to a plain "unsigned int" in time-critical apps which are known to work in a single thread.</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CStream now handles sizes as uint64_t instead of size_t, to allow files larger than 4Gb in 32bit systems.</li>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::prepareVideoSourceFromUserSelection() now also displays as an option to grab images from SwissRanger 3D cameras.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::CGenericSensor:<ul>
<li>Now has a generic interface for external image directories (it was only in CCameraSensor before), so more sensors can use this feature.</li>
<li>The sensor label member is now "m_sensorLabel" in this base class, instead of replicating it in all children classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::slam::CObservation3DRangeScan:<ul>
<li>The confidence channel is stored as an image instead of a matrix to optimize memory and disk space.</li>
<li>New "auto-calibration" method: CObservation3DRangeScan::recoverCameraCalibrationParameters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::CSwissRanger3DCamera is now prepared to store intensity &amp; confidence channels to external image files to save rawlog storage size.</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CStream now has methods for sending/receiving messages in a predefined frame format. See mrpt::utils::CStream::receiveMessage, mrpt::utils::CStream::sendMessage.</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CConfigFileMemory has a new method getContent().</li>
<li>Template mrpt::utils::TParameters now has typedefs mrpt::utils::TParametersDouble, mrpt::utils::TParametersString and many new methods. See the example params-by-name.</li>
<li>New method TCamera::scaleToResolution() for scale camera calibration params for different resolutions.</li>
<li>In mrpt::slam::CMetricMap<ul>
<li>New method loadFromSimpleMap() (fast inline call to loadFromProbabilisticPosesAndObservations, with a better name!).</li>
<li>The method alignBylikelihoodHillClimbing() has been removed, since it didn't make sense there and was a pretty old and unefficient implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In mrpt::slam::CSimpleMap:<ul>
<li>New methods loadFromFile() and saveToFile().</li>
<li>Added STL-like iterators and such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::slam::CObservationGPS: Fixed const'ness of the getAsStruct&lt;&gt;() methods.</li>
<li>Absolute pixel coordinates are now permited where previously there were only factors over width/height. See:<ul>
<li>mrpt::opengl::COpenGLViewport::setViewportPosition and mrpt::opengl::COpenGLViewport::getViewportPosition.</li>
<li>mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D::addTextMessage.</li>
<li>CMyGLCanvasBase::renderTextBitmap (now accepts negative pixel coords as well, meaning to wrap).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::CGenericSensor::registerClass is now public.</li>
<li>All MRPT containers (mrpt::vector_double, all kind of matrices, arrays, etc) now have two new methods for saving to and loading from text files "as vectors", i.e. even for matrices, all the elements are saved/loaded as a simple sequence:<ul>
<li>loadFromTextFileAsVector</li>
<li>saveToTextFileAsVector</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::CActivMediaRobotBase can now transparently open serial ports &gt;COM4 in Windows without the prefix "\\.\" (it's added automatically if needed).</li>
<li>The ANN library has been moved from mrpt-maps to mrpt-base (still can be reached at the same path under &lt;mrpt/otherlibs/ann/...&gt;. This is to allow more code to use KD-trees without depending on mrpt-maps.</li>
<li>mrpt::vision::TPixelCoordf now holds "float" coordinates instead of "double" since: it's enough for pixels, to save memory, and for consistency in name suffixes "f".</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CCanvas now uses TColor as color data type, instead of "int"s (finally!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New functions:<ul>
<li>mrpt::math::kmeans, mrpt::math::kmeanspp: Efficient implementations of k-means and k-means++ algorithms. By David Arthur (Standford, USA) (See <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~darthur/kmpp.zip">http://www.stanford.edu/~darthur/kmpp.zip</a> ).</li>
<li>mrpt::vision::findMultipleChessboardsCorners</li>
<li>mrpt::vision::camera_calib_ba is a new method based on Bundle-Adjustment to calibrate a camera from the tracking of a set of random points.</li>

<li>mrpt::topography::ENUToGeocentric</li>
<li>mrpt::gui::CMyGLCanvasBase::textBitmapWidth, a new function to compute the width of a bitmap string.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New classes:<ul>
<li>mrpt::hwdrivers::CStereoGrabber_SVS: New class to grab from a Videre Stereo camera (By Cyril Gerber, thanks!). Support has been also built into mrpt::hwdrivers::CCameraSensor.</li>
<li>New hierarchy of computer vision detectors/detectable objects. See new namespace mrpt::detectors for the new library mrpt-detectors.</li>
<li>mrpt::math::CSparseMatrix for efficient sparse matrix computations (based on code from robotvision &amp; the CSparse library - see the class doc for more details and credits).</li>
<li>New generalized KD-tree pattern class: mrpt::math::KDTreeCapable, previously used only for points of maps, now used in more places.</li>
<li>Feature tracking for images now has a set of different implementations. See mrpt::vision::CGenericFeatureTracker</li>

<h2>Version 0.9.0: Released 3-JUN-2010 (SVN 1880) </h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Most relevant changes:</b><ul>
<li>New minor version number started (0.9.0) due to incompatible changes in the ABI and in some parts of the API (read below for "Important changes in the API").</li>
<li>The previous "mrpt-core" library has been split into several smaller libs for better modularity, less dependencies of user programs and faster recompiling.</li>
<li>Compile/build: Support for MSVC 2010.</li>
<li>Support for the 3D cameras SR3000/SR4000. See mrpt::hwdrivers::CSwissRanger3DCamera and <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/Example:SwissRanger_SR4000_3D_camera">this example</a>.</li>
<li>The library mrpt-htmslam is now part of public MRPT releases (I tried to also release hmt-slam-gui but it would delay for too long... still in SVN only for now).</li>
<li>The program 'icp-slam', and mrpt::slam::CMetricMapBuilderICP, are now capable of handling two kinds of rawlogs: based on CSensoryFrame's (as usual), and the newest only containing CObservation's. Note however that ICP-SLAM now requires all odometry actions/observations to have a valid timestamp (very old datasets &lt;=2007 would need to be fixed in RawlogViewer).</li>
<li>An important conceptual milestone: New base class mrpt::utils::CObject created to unify the MRPT RTTI system, instead of loading everything on CSerializable (which is now a derived class of CObject). This allows taking advantage of MRPT's smart pointers without forcing to implement serialization. Existing user code should be not affected at all.</li>
<li>Fixed critical bugs in rawlog-grabber and in 6D KF-SLAM (read below).</li>
<li>MRPT now uses Google's unit test framework (gtest). Dozens of automated tests already exist to provide a robust, continuous checking of the health of MRPT core functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="0.9.0.API"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Important changes in the API:</b> Changes that *may* break existing user code.<ul>
<li>Calls to buildAuxPointsMap() in some CObservation-derived classes must be replaced by buildAuxPointsMap&lt;CPointsMap&gt;().</li>
<li>Localization with particle filters is now implemented in mrpt::slam::CMonteCarloLocalization2D, and mrpt::poses::CPosePDFParticles is now just a data storage class, used as a base class. If you used this class in your code, an option is to employ macros like "#if MRPT_VERSION&gt;=0x090", etc. to handle different versions of MRPT.</li>
<li>mrpt::slam::CObservationImage and mrpt::slam::CObservationStereoImages now use a structure mrpt::utils::TCamera instead of separate fields for focal length, intrinsic and distortion parameters.</li>
<li>color functions moved from mrpt::vision to mrpt::utils (See mrpt::utils::colormap, ...).</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CImage: The method cross_correlation() is now what was previously called openCV_cross_correlation().</li>
<li>mrpt::vision::openCV_cross_correlation() function deleted, since it's already in CImage.</li>
<li>mrpt::slam::CObservation::likelihoodWith() has been removed. It's somehow replaced by mrpt:slam::observationsOverlap().</li>
<li>COccupancyGridMap2D::extractFeatures(), COccupancyGridMap2D::extractFeatures(), ... have been moved out of the map itself to a new class: mrpt::slam::COccupancyGridMapFeatureExtractor.</li>
<li>CImageGrabber_OpenCV, CImageGrabber_dc1394 and CStereoGrabber_Bumblebee: Have been moved from mrpt::vision to mrpt::hwdrivers, its natural place. Users using these classes thru CCameraSensor will not realize of the difference.</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::TMatchingPair and mrpt::utils::TMatchingPairList have been moved from been member classes of mrpt::slam::CMetricMap to be independent structures, now sited in mrpt-base for a more spread usage. Note that for compatibility there are still typedefs within CMetricMap, but it's recommended to use the new names of the structs.</li>
<li>The member mrpt::slam::CPointsMap::TInsertionOptions::matchStaticPointsOnly has been removed, since it had little practical utility and broke independence between sub-libraries.</li>
<li>The header &lt;mrpt/slam/pose_graph_optimizers.h&gt; has been renamed &lt;mrpt/slam/graph_slam.h&gt;.</li>
<li>The class CRobotSimulator has been moved from mrpt::slam to mrpt::utils, since it had nothing to do with SLAM.</li>
<li>The function mrpt::hwdrivers::registerAllSensors() has been removed, since it's now not needed (registration is now done reliably at startup).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Detailed list of changes:</b><ul>
<li>Applications:<ul>
<li>simul-landmarks:<ul>
<li>New parameter "show_in_3d" to display a 3D view with the complete simulated robot path and landmarks.</li>
<li>It can now simulate random walks of a robot in 6D, not only over a 2D plane as in previous versions.</li>
<li>Generated rawlogs are gz-compressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RawlogViewer:<ul>
<li>Much more efficient operations of cutting a rawlog (removing a part, keeping a part only), via a new method mrpt::CRawlog::remove() for ranges of indices.</li>
<li>The program can now export all the images from a given camera as an AVI file (or two, for stereo cameras).</li>
<li>New menu option to regenerate the odometry timestamps of very old datasets (&lt;=2007).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>icp-slam:<ul>
<li>The program 'icp-slam', and mrpt::slam::CMetricMapBuilderICP, are now capable of handling two kinds of rawlogs: based on CSensoryFrame's (as usual), and the newest only containing CObservation's.</li>
<li>New parameters to set a minimum distance between pose correction with ICP, for faster execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>kf-slam:<ul>
<li>Now has a much more rich live visualization as a 3D view. See <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/Application:kf-slam">http://www.mrpt.org/Application:kf-slam</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ICP and RBPF SLAM now have a new option to always insert any kind of CObservation-derived class. See mrpt::slam::CMetricMapBuilder::TOptions::alwaysInsertByClass</li>
<li>rawlog-grabber: Now supports extra sensors defined by the user by means of compile-time "plug ins". See <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/Application:rawlog-grabber">http://www.mrpt.org/Application:rawlog-grabber</a></li>

<li>Implementation of the observer/observable design pattern in the classes: mrpt::utils::CObservable &amp; mrpt::utils::CObserver . See also the example "observer_pattern".</li>
<li>Usage of the observer/observable design to dispatch events in GUI windows. See mrpt::gui::CBaseGUIWindow.</li>
<li>Usage of the observer/observable design to enable anyone to subscribe to changes in metric maps. See mrpt::slam::mrptEventMetricMapInsert, - New set of classes to represent 6D poses using 3D translation + a quaternion for rotation:<ul>

<li>New OpenGL class: mrpt::opengl::CBox, for representing rectangular solid or wireframed boxes.</li>
<li>New class: mrpt::utils::CListOfClasses</li>
<li>New class mrpt::poses::CRobot2DPoseEstimator: A simple filter to estimate and extrapolate the robot 2D (x,y,phi) pose from asynchronous odometry and localization data.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>BUG FIXES:</b><ul>
<li>mrpt::utils::CConfigFileBase didn't always remove extra leading and trailing whitespaces in read_string().</li>
<li>Initial size of the window was ignored in mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D.</li>
<li>Error returning 2x1 size() in dynamic matrices, since there was only one static member shared by all matrices.</li>
<li>Swapped red-blue channels in mrpt::gui::wxImage2MRPTImage (Closes <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/node/70">this issue</a>).</li>
<li>mrpt::poses::CPose3D undefined values when initializing from a "-" operator, due to bug in mrpt::math::homogeneousMatrixInverse().</li>
<li>mrpt::math::CHistogram::getBinRatio() and hence mrpt::math::histogram when do_normalization=true, always returned zero.</li>
<li>Fixed crash in rawlog-grabber when grabbing from a (non-stereo) camera and enabling preview (Closes <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2988657&amp;group_id=205280&amp;atid=993006">SF #2988657 </a>).</li>
<li>When grabbing images with mrpt::hwdrivers::CCameraSensor and decimation is enabled in mrpt::hwdrivers::CGenericSensor, all the images were saved to disk. It's been fixed so only the decimated ones are saved.</li>
<li>Fixed direction errors in the computation of 3D rays of OpenGL viewports for perspective projection. See mrpt::opengl::COpenGLViewport::get3DRayForPixelCoord()</li>
<li>RawLogViewer: When loading gz-compressed rawlogs, the "Loading" dialog may close too early.</li>

<h2>Version 0.8.1: Released 6-MAR-2010 (svn 1590). </h2>
<ul>
<li>A very large reorganization and improvement of "mrpt::math". Thanks to Pablo Moreno for his big work here.<ul>
<li>Added a forward declarations header &lt;mrpt/math/math_fwrds.h&gt;</li>
<li>New header &lt;mrpt/math/ops_containers.h&gt; with general arithmetic operations applicable to vectors, arrays and matrices of any kind.</li>
<li>Most matrix template implementations moved to &lt;mrpt/math/ops_matrices.h&gt;. User code that already included &lt;mrpt/slam.h&gt; will need no change to keep compiling OK.</li>
<li>More small functions marked as inline.</li>
<li>Fixed some specializations that weren't actually called due to issues with forward declarations.</li>
<li>Clean up of the mrpt::math namespace by moving auxiliary functions to mrpt::math::detail.</li>
<li>All kind of matrices now have dozens of common methods (multiply, leftDivide, rightDivide, inverse, det, eigenValues,...); this includes matrix views.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added md5 cryptographic hash function to utils.</li>
<li>MRPT can be now built in Win64.</li>
<li>Sonar observations are now processed in point maps. See CSimplePointsMap::insertObservation for arguments of type mrpt::slam::CObservationRange.</li>
<li>More robust wxSubsystem in mrpt::gui classes.</li>
<li>Occupancy grid maps now have a method to simulate sonar sensors. See COccupancyGridMap2D::sonarSimulator.</li>
<li>All 3D objects in mrpt::opengl now have a visible/invisible property. See mrpt::opengl::CRenderizable::setVisibility</li>
<li>3D views (mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D and mrpt::gui::CMyGLCanvasBase) now have:<ul>
<li>Functions to determine the 3D rays for coordinates picked by the user with the mouse. See the example "display3D".</li>
<li>A way to obtain the camera pose as a CPose3D object (see COpenGLViewport::getCurrentCameraPose).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New application: navlog-viewer. A GUI tool to reproduce and examine navigation logs. See the applications wiki for more details.</li>
<li>mrpt::opengl::CTexturedObject, a new base class to factor code for all mrpt::opengl classes loading/unloading texture images.</li>
<li>Particle filters now have new options: verbose, pfAuxFilterOptimal_MLE.</li>
<li>read_bool() for INI-like files now accepts "yes/no" and "true/false" apart from "1/0".</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CTimeLogger now can export all the timing data to a CSV file.</li>
<li>mrpt::math::CQuaternion has been "modernized": it now inherits from CArray&lt;T,4&gt; and many methods are inline and templates.</li>
<li>An important refactoring of code in all Particle Filters, both for localization and RBPF-mapping. As a result, with thousands lines of code less, many more algorithms and applications are now supported:<ul>
<li>The following classes: mrpt::poses::CPosePDFParticles, mrpt::slam::CMultiMetricMapPDF now support any combination of these algorithms:<ul>
<li>pfStandardProposal (SIR), sample size: fixed OR KLD-based dynamic size, different resampling strategies (mrpt::bayes::CParticleFilter::TParticleResamplingAlgorithm).</li>
<li>pfAuxiliaryPFStandard (APF), sample size: fixed OR KLD-based dynamic size.</li>
<li>pfAuxiliaryPFOptimal (Blanco et al.), sample size: fixed OR KLD-based dynamic size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mrpt::system::aligned_malloc and family now work on all OS's and are used to align the memory of rows in dynamic matrices.</li>
<li>Due to many enhancements in the "template-fication" of MRPT, it's no longer equivalent to use std::vector&lt;double&gt; or vector_double, etc... The later form is the only one supported.</li>
<li>New set of classes to allow operating on a transformation of a matrix without building the auxiliary matrix, e.g. transpose, submatrices, etc... See mrpt::math::CMatrixView</li>
<li>The following classes have fully STL-like iterators, reverse_iterators and container-like methods (begin(),end(),...):<ul>
<li>mrpt::math::CMatrixFixedNumeric (and derived classes)</li>

<li>News in Kalman Filter implementation:<ul>
<li>New option to compute custom "new landmark"'s covariance, which is needed by, eg. MonoSLAM. The old version of "OnInverseObservationModel" still exists for backward-compatibility. See the new mrpt::bayes::OnInverseObservationModel.</li>
<li>Implementing the Jacobians is now optional. If the corresponding virtual methods are not implemented, it will be automatically detected and numeric approximation of the Jacobians will be estimated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All plots based on wxMathPlot now has a new entry in the popup menu for printing the plot to PS/PDF.</li>
<li>wxMathPlot updated to version 0.1.2 (Dec-2009).</li>
<li>Poses and point classes in mrpt::poses now have the operator[], usable in the new template constructor of mrpt::math::CArrayNumeric</li>
<li>mrpt::utils::CLoadableOptions now also allows writting the configuration to files, not only reading.</li>
<li>Build system:<ul>
<li>Fixed the detection of some standard functions (erfc,lrint,...) under GCC for defining the HAVE_XXX's in config.h</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Version 0.7.0: Released 27-May-2009 (SVN 1042). </h2>
<ul>
<li><b>IMPORTANT CHANGES</b>:<ul>
<li>Old deprecated methods removed.</li>
<li>Changes which may require modifications in user's code:<ul>
<li>Interface of all probability density functions (PDF) changed for efficiency: getEstimatedMean -&gt; getMean, getEstimatedCov -&gt; getCovarianceAndMean or getCovariance ; and objects returned by referenced instead of returning a copy. Old PDF interface methods marked as deprecated (and will dissapear in future releases).</li>
<li>Members x y z (and phi yaw pitch roll where applicable) from mrpt::poses::CPoseOrPoint and derived classes are not public anymore. They must be read out with inline members x(), y() and so on, and written with x(newval), y(newval), etc... This change is needed to assure that the internal state, e.g. in mrpt::poses::CPose3D, is always consistent.</li>
<li>A few matrix arithmetic methods renamed for consistency: Now all start with "multiply_XXX", "add_XXX", etc...</li>
<li>Some constructors in poses,points &amp; matrices marked as "explicit" to avoid unintended conversions.</li>
<li>Random number generators marked as deprecated. New programs should use the new object mrpt::random::randomGenerator or instance objects of the class mrpt::random::CRandomGenerator for thread-safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All covariance matrices passed to a new matrix class with compile time fixed-size, with dramatic speed ups.</li>
<li>Data declarations in geometry.h have been moved to lightweight_geom_data, although TPolygons and TObjects are not really lightweight (Pablo).</li>
<li>mrpt::vision now integrates SURF features (Requires OpenCV 1.1.0, integrated by Francisco-Angel Moreno), and new interest point descriptors.</li>
<li>New hardware supported:<ul>
<li>IP cameras via rtsp:// protocol (due to support of FFmpeg libraries).</li>
<li>xSens IMU, MTi devices (Built-in version of XSens library).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Win32 only: .lib and .dll files now have a postfix with the MRPT version, that is, "libmrpt-core070.lib" instead of "libmrpt-core.lib", etc...</li>
<li>New algorithms: A generic and applied RANSAC, Dijkstra for graphs, an optimizer for networks of relative poses and data association algorithms. See the list of changes below.</li>
<li>Efficient geometry structures and dozens of new geomtry methods (mainly by Pablo Moreno).</li>
<li>Geometry methods improved, corrected and expanded in mrpt::math (by Pablo Moreno). See the list of changes below.</li>

<li>New programs:<ul>
<li>camera-calib: A new GUI program (fused of old "camera-calib" &amp; "camera-calib-gui") for camera calibration with live camera capture.</li>
<li>features-matching: A new computer vision demo application.</li>
<li>2d-slam-demo: A GUI application which allows the user to run a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementation of range-bearing 2D SLAM in step-by-step or continuous mode.</li>

<li>Small changes in polyhedron intersection demo (Pablo).</li>
<li>Added methods to agglutinate vectors of mrpt::math::TSegment3D into vectors of (probably skew) mrpt::math::TPolygon3D. Due to their similarities, this code may evolve into a template in the future, so that it's suitable for both 2D and 3D objects (Pablo).</li>
