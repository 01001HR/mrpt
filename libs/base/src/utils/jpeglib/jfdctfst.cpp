 * rather than carrying additional fractional bits into subsequent additions.
 * This compromises accuracy slightly, but it lets us save a few shifts.
 * More importantly, 16-bit arithmetic is then adequate (for 8-bit samples)
 * everywhere except in the multiplications proper; this saves a good deal
 * of work on 16-bit-int machines.
 *
 * Again to save a few shifts, the intermediate results between pass 1 and
 * pass 2 are not upscaled, but are represented only to integral precision.
 *
 * A final compromise is to represent the multiplicative constants to only
 * 8 fractional bits, rather than 13.  This saves some shifting work on some
 * machines, and may also reduce the cost of multiplication (since there
 * are fewer one-bits in the constants).
